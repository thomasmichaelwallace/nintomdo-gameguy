# tilt-out

A set of games to run on a t-shirt and control with your body:

* breakout (lean left/right to move the paddle)
* tetris (lean left/right to move the piece, jump to rotate clock-wise)
* snake (lean left/right to twist the snake)

A project for EMF 2024 designed for the Stellar Unicorn and the MSA311 breakout board.
